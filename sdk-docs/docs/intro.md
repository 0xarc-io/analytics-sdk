# Introduction

The 0xArc Analytics SDK is a simple SDK that helps provide higher fidelity analytics by merging on-chain data with off-chain data from front-ends. We value user privacy and do not collect IP addresses or scrape any information without your permission.

# Important Notes

We do not support automatic wallet activity tracking with wallets other than Metamask.

Unless your dApp uses _only_ Metamask, you need to either use the [React](/docs/category/1-react) or [Manual](/docs/category/2-manual) installation methods.

## Getting Started

Get started by installing the SDK. We offer 3 different ways to install the SDK:

1. [React](/docs/react/installation-react) - This is the recommended way to install the SDK if you are using React. Available through NPM.

2. [NPM Installation with JS Usage](/docs/manual/installation-manual) - This is the recommended way to install the SDK if you are not using React. Available through NPM.

3. [HTML Script tag](/docs/script/installation-script) - This option is allows installing the SDK via a script tag from a CDN. Only supports Metamask.
