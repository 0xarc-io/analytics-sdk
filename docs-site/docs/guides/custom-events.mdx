# Custom Events

This guide contains best practices for naming and using custom events.

For the API usage of custom events, please refer to the [Custom Events](/tracking/manual/event) docs.

## What is a Custom Event?

Custom events are a way to track specific actions or interactions that occur in your application. They are extremely flexible, and can be used to track any off-chain or on-chain event in your application.

There are two parts to custom events, the event name itself, and the custom event attributes.

For example, let's say we we want to log a custom event when a user opens the MetaMask modal. Let's call it something like "deposit attempted".

##### React Example

```tsx
import { useArcxAnalytics } from '@0xarc-io/analytics'

const Component = () => {
  const sdk = useArcxAnalytics()

  const handleClick = async () => {
    await sdk.event('DEPOSIT_ATTEMPED', {
      transactionHash: '0x1234567890abcdef',
      chainId: 1,
      metadata: {
        apiVersion: 'v1',
      },
    })
  }

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>User opens MetaMask modal</button>
}
```

You can see that we used the `sdk.event()` method to log the custom event. The first string argument `'DEPOSITED_ATTEMPTED'` is the custom event name, and we can name it anything we want. The second argument is an optional object of custom event attributes, which are arbitrary key-value pairs that you can use to add any additional information about the events.

## When to use custom events vs the provided SDK events

As seen on the [Manual Tracking](/category/manual-tracking) pages, we have provided a handful of convenience methods for logging common events:

- [Page Events](/tracking/manual/page)
- [Wallet Connection Events](/tracking/manual/wallet)
- [Wallet Disconnection Events](/tracking/manual/disconnection)
- [Chain Change Events](/tracking/manual/chain)
- [Transaction Submitted Events](/tracking/manual/transaction)
- [Signature Events](/tracking/manual/signature)

As the name implies, these events are provided for convenience, but may not necessarily exhaust all the events that you want to track.

If you want more granular control over the events you track, you can use custom events which are extremely flexible.

For example, if you want to have more granular coverage of the transaction process beyond just transaction submission, [you can do so with custom events](/guides/transactions)

## Naming events

There are no strict rules on how to name custom events, but here are some best practices:

### Consistency

No matter which naming conventions you choose to use for your custom events, it is important to be consistent. Consistent naming makes it easier to track event behaviour over time and understand your data.

If event names are inconsistent or change often, it becomes difficult to understand the data and the meaning of the events.

### Casing

The recommended approach to casing for events is to use capitalized snake_case for the event name, and camelCase for the event attribute keys:

- Event name: "deposit attempted" becomes `DEPOSIT_ATTEMPTED`
- Event attributes:
  - "transaction hash" becomes `transactionHash`
  - "chain ID" becomes `chainId`

By using capitalized snake_case for the event name, it appears more readable, indicates that it's a constant and that it's value does not change over time.

### Use Noun-Verb Structure for Custom Event Names

When naming events, use a noun-verb structure rather than a verb-noun structure. This makes it easier to group the actions by event or noun type.

| Event                 | ✅ Good naming (noun-verb) | ❌ Bad naming (verb-noun) |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Wallet connected      | `WALLET_CONNECTED`         | `CONNECT_WALLET`          |
| Wallet disconnected   | `WALLET_DISCONNECTED`      | `DISCONNECTED_WALLET`     |
| Transaction submitted | `TRANSACTION_SUBMITTED`    | `SUBMITTED_TRANSACTION`   |
| Transaction confirmed | `TRANSACTION_CONFIRMED`    | `CONFIRMED_TRANSACTION`   |
| Token approved        | `TOKEN_APPROVED`           | `APPROVED_TOKEN`          |

As you can see, noun-verb structure makes it easier to group and analyze related events together.

## Custom Events and funnels

A powerful benefit of custom events is that they can be used to create funnels.

Funnel are a way to track the user journey through your application, and see the drop-off rate at each step.

### Step 1. Create a funnel

To create a funnel in the [0xArc app](https://app.0xarc.io/), visit the funnels page and click the "Create funnel" button.

<img src={Funnel1} width="800" />

### Step 2. Add custom events to the funnel

You can use the custom events you've emitted as the steps in the funnel.

For example, in the image below, we click "Select condition" -> "Events" -> "Custom" -> and then in the list, we see the custom events we've emitted. Note that this list is limited to 10, and the input allows you to search our database for all custom events, by custom event name.

<img src={Funnel2} width="800" />

We see here that our 2 events are `WALLET_OPENED`, and `Chart Tab Selected`.

### Step 3. Apply the event

After you select an event and click "Apply", you can see the funnel in action.

On the right, you will see a count of how many users have taken the action in your app which triggered that custom event.

<img src={Funnel3} width="800" />

In our case, we can see that 486 wallet open events were captured.

### Step 4. Filter the custom event by attribute

Now that we have our custom event in the funnel, we can filter that event by key-value pairs of the custom event attributes.

For example below, we filter the event by the `apiVersion` attribute, and check that the apiVersion is equal to `2`.

<img src={Funnel4} width="400" />

Note that if you want to filter by a custom event attribute, you can either:

- Add both a "Custom Event Key" **and** a "Custom Event Value" filter, which will filter the funnel to only show events where the "Custom Event Key" is present and equal to "Custom Event Value".
- Add only a "Custom Event Key" filter, in which case the funnel will show the count of events where the "Custom Event Key" is present, regardless of what value it is.

We do not support adding only a "Custom Event Value" filter, since values must match a Custom Event Key.
