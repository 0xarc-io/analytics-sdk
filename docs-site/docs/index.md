# 1. Introduction

The 0xArc Analytics SDK is a simple SDK that helps provide higher fidelity analytics by merging on-chain data with off-chain data from front-ends. We value user privacy and do not collect IP addresses or scrape any information without your permission.

# Important Notes

We do not support automatic wallet activity tracking with wallets other than Metamask.

Unless your dApp uses _only_ Metamask, you need to use the [NPM](/installation/installation-npm)
