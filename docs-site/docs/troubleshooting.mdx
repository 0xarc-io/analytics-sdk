# Troubleshooting

## Confirm the events are being sent

To confirm that events are being sent, you can utilise our Live Event Feed in the project settings.

1. Navigate to the [0xArc App](https://app.0xarc.io).
2. Click on the Projects dropdown at the top of the sidebar on the left.

4. Scroll to the "Live Event Feed" section at the bottom of the page.

5. When you emit events via the SDK, you should see them appear in the Live Event Feed. If you see them coming through, success!
