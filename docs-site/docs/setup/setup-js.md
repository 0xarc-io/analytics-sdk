# JavaScript

This method utilises the JS in non-react projects to initialize the SDK.

This is the recommended way to install the SDK if you are not using React. Installation is available through NPM and API usage is via JS.

---

### 1. Import the SDK class

```tsx
import { ArcxAnalyticsSdk } from '@0xarc-io/analytics'
```

---

### 3. Initialize the SDK

To initialize the Analytics SDK one should invoke the `.init()` method on the class. This configures the SDK with your API key and, optionally, configuration options.

**Note**: you do not need to call this function if using the React provider. But the configuration options below are instead passed into the `config` prop of the `ArcxAnalyticsProvider` component. See [here](/tracking/automatic#configuration-options).

Initialize the SDK and keep an instance of it ready to reference in other parts of your app. To do this, add the following code on your appâ€™s load:

```tsx
const sdk = await ArcxAnalyticsSdk.init(
  'YOUR_API_KEY', // The 0xArc-provided API key
  {
    // list any features you'd like to disable here
    cacheIdentity: true,
    trackReferrer: true,
    trackPages: true,
    trackUTM: true,
    trackTransactions: true,
  },
)
```

### `.init()` Parameters

- `apiKey` **(string)** - the 0xArc-provided API key. See [here](/retrieve-api-key) for instructions on how to retrieve your API key.
- `config` **(object)** - overrides of the default [SDK configuration](/tracking/automatic#configuration-options).

---

### 4. Configure the API key

If you haven't already, you can retrieve your API key by following the instructions in the [Retrieve your API Key](/retrieve-api-key) docs.

Once you have your API key, pass the value of the `API_KEY` argument in the code snippet above to your API key.

Note that the api key is required. The key is a string that uniquely identifies your project. Since it is a public key, you can safely expose it to the client.

### 5. Start tracking

You are now ready to go! You now have two options for tracking events:

1. You can utilise the [default configuration options](/tracking/automatic) for automatic tracking, or
2. [Begin tracking events manually](/category/manual-tracking) for more fine-grained control
