# 2. Retrieve your API Key

A public API key is required to initialize the SDK.

Note, since it is a public key, you can safely expose it to the client.

If you already have an account on the 0xArc App - you're one step closer to getting started. [Below we'll walk you through the process of retrieving your API key.](/retrieve-api-key#i-already-have-an-account-on-the-0xarc-app)

If you don't already have an account, [you can get started in a few minutes by creating a project on the 0xArc App.](/retrieve-api-key#i-dont-have-an-account-on-the-0xarc-app)
